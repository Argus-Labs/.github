_"The beginning of a new world - I call it the seed.

Once it sprouts, you'll know what it is.

What you do with it is up to you.” - Kayaba Akihiko_

At Argus Labs, we are shaping the future of games through bleeding-edge applied research in distributed systems and game design.

We are the primary developer of the [World Engine](https://github.com/argus-labs/world-engine) -- a next-generation game backend infrastructure that allows core game logic and data to interoperate with user-generated content and 3rd party platforms.
