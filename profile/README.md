At Argus Labs, we are shaping the future of games through applied research in distributed systems and game design. 

We are the primary developer of the [World Engine](https://github.com/argus-labs/world-engine) — a next-generation game backend infrastructure that allows core game logic and data to interoperate with user-generated content and 3rd party platforms seamlessly.
